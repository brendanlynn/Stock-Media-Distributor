# Brendan's Stock Media Distributor

Brendan's Stock Media Distributor is a .NET desktop application. It uses GenAI to catagorize and generate captions and keywords for images and videos, and then can copy them to external locations where a FTP client such as [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) can be used to then copy it to a server such as Adobe Stock or Shutterstock.
