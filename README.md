# Brendan's Stock Media Distributor

Brendan's Stock Media Distributor is a .NET desktop application. It uses GenAI to catagorize and generate captions and keywords for images and videos, and then can copy them to external locations where a FTP client such as [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) can be used to then copy it to a server such as Adobe Stock or Shutterstock.

> I made this project a long time ago, but only uploaded it recently. This repository had not been maintained for a much longer time than the archived date would suggest. Please do not judge my present or future coding ability by this project, which is far below the standard of any project I publish or maintain in the present, or will publish or maintain in the future. Thank you.
